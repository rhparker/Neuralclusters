\opening{Dear Editor,}

On behalf of my co-author, Andrea K. Barreiro, I would like to submit the article ``Bifurcations of a neural network model with symmetry'' for consideration of publication in the SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems. In this article, we analyze a family of clustered excitatory-inhibitory neural networks and the underlying bifurcation structures that arise because of permutation symmetries. This work has not been published or submitted elsewhere.


\closing{Sincerely,}

\end{letter}
